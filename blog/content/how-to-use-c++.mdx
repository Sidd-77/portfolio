With this markup you can obtain simple emhpasis (usually rendered in italic text), strong emphasis (usually rendered in bold text), source code text (usually rendered in monospaced text), or ~~strikethrough~~ text (usually rendered with a line through text).

You may use also this or this notation to emphatize text, and you can use all them together (and you can mix \* and \_ )

If you look at the source code you may note that even if you break the lines, the text is kept together in a single paragraph

Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines, leading and trailing spaces are removed

You may force a line break with two spaces
or with a \
at the end of the line
